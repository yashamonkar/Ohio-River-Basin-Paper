Abstract -  growing concern with the clustering of extreme climate events is driving literature on compound climate risk. 
Here, we demonstrate that low-frequency climate variability leads to spatial and temporal clustering of risk of regional climate extremes. 
The example developed is for the Ohio River Basin, with a focus on flooding.
Long records of annual maximum streamflow from 25 USGS gauges are used to explore the regional spatiotemporal patterns of flooding and their associated large-scale climate modes.
We find that the dominant time scales of flood risk in this basin are in the interannual (6-7 years), decadal (11-13 years), and secular bands and that different sub-regions within the Ohio River Basin respond differently to large-scale forcing.
We show the leading modes of streamflow variability are associated with ENSO and characterized by long secular trends. 
The low-frequency climate modes translate into epochs of increased and decreased flood risk with multiple extreme floods or the absence of extreme floods, thus informing the nature of compound climate-induced flood risk.  
These findings highlight that compound climate risk at regional scales may need to be considered by local governments, financial institutions, industries with long supply chains, and owners of physical infrastructure, including aging dams that are likely to be vulnerable to cascading failures from regional-scale flooding.
