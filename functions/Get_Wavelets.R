### Wavelet Function

#WAVELET  1D Wavelet transform with optional singificance testing
#
#   [WAVE,PERIOD,SCALE,COI] = wavelet(Y,DT,PAD,DJ,S0,J1,MOTHER,PARAM)
#
#   Computes the wavelet transform of the vector Y (length N),
#   with sampling rate DT.
#
#   By default, the Morlet wavelet (k0=6) is used.
#   The wavelet basis is normalized to have total energy=1 at all scales.
#
#
# INPUTS:
#
#    Y = the time series of length N.
#    DT = amount of time between each Y value, i.e. the sampling time.
#
# OUTPUTS:
#
#    WAVE is the WAVELET transform of Y. This is a complex array
#    of dimensions (N,J1+1). FLOAT(WAVE) gives the WAVELET amplitude,
#    ATAN(IMAGINARY(WAVE),FLOAT(WAVE) gives the WAVELET phase.
#    The WAVELET power spectrum is ABS(WAVE)^2.
#    Its units are sigma^2 (the time series variance).
#
#
# OPTIONAL INPUTS:
# 
# *** Note *** setting any of the following to -1 will cause the default
#               value to be used.
#
#    PAD = if set to 1 (default is 0), pad time series with enough zeroes to get
#         N up to the next higher power of 2. This prevents wraparound
#         from the end of the time series to the beginning, and also
#         speeds up the FFT's used to do the wavelet transform.
#         This will not eliminate all edge effects (see COI below).
#
#    DJ = the spacing between discrete scales. Default is 0.25.
#         A smaller # will give better scale resolution, but be slower to plot.
#
#    S0 = the smallest scale of the wavelet.  Default is 2*DT.
#
#    J1 = the # of scales minus one. Scales range from S0 up to S0*2^(J1*DJ),
#        to give a total of (J1+1) scales. Default is J1 = (LOG2(N DT/S0))/DJ.
#
#    MOTHER = the mother wavelet function.
#             The choices are 'MORLET', 'PAUL', or 'DOG'
#
#    PARAM = the mother wavelet parameter.
#            For 'MORLET' this is k0 (wavenumber), default is 6.
#            For 'PAUL' this is m (order), default is 4.
#            For 'DOG' this is m (m-th derivative), default is 2.
#
#
# OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
#
#    PERIOD = the vector of "Fourier" periods (in time units) that corresponds
#           to the SCALEs.
#
#    SCALE = the vector of scale indices, given by S0*2^(j*DJ), j=0...J1
#            where J1+1 is the total # of scales.
#
#    COI = if specified, then return the Cone-of-Influence, which is a vector
#        of N points that contains the maximum period of useful information
#        at that particular time.
#        Periods greater than this are subject to edge effects.
#        This can be used to plot COI lines on a contour plot by doing:
#
#              contour(time,log(period),log(power))
#              plot(time,log(coi),'k')
